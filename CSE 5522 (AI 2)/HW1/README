ANSWER TO QUESTION 4 PART C:
---------------------------------
the alpha is basically how large do you want to take steps in each iteration.
the larger the alpha is, the faster you will converge.
However, if you pick a significantly larger alpha, you most likely will miss the target, because you took too large of a step.
At the same time, if you pick a VERY small alpha, it takes a very long time for your program to converge.


It was a fun assignment.
Should have put more time on it.
